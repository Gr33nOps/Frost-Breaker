# Frost Breaker

**Frost Breaker** is a retro Arkanoid-style arcade game built with C++ and SFML. The gameplay follows the classic brick breaker formula with a frost-themed twist. Instead of regular bricks, the player breaks frozen blocks using a frost ball and frost paddle.

The goal is to clear all blocks by keeping the ball in play and bouncing it off the paddle. The game focuses on simple mechanics, responsive controls, and a clean modular structure for learning and practice.
